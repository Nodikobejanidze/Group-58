        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>A website also written as a web site is one or more web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. The most-visited sites are Google, YouTube, and Facebook.</p><br>

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web  was created in 1989 by the British CERN computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.
             On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to use for anyone, contributing to the immense growth of the Web. Before the introduction of the Hypertext
              Transfer Protocol , other protocols such as File Transfer Protocol and the gopher protocol were used to retrieve individual files from a server. 
              Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in word processor formats.  
                These protocols offer a simple directory structure in which the user navigates and where they choose files to download

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>While "web site" was the original spelling sometimes capitalized "Web site",
            since "Web" is a proper noun when referring to the World Wide Web,
            this variant has become rarely used, and "website" has become the standard spelling. All major style guides, such as The Chicago
            Manual of Style and the AP Stylebook, have reflected this change.
