                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's dowry[10] and patented in January 1886[11] – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).</p>

                <p>Some people think a choice has to be made between motorcycles and cars. Either you’re a car lunatic or you are a motorcycle nut, but not both! This common misconception is getting thrown off the boat thanks to a partnership between Mercedes-AMG and MV Motorcycles. Mercedes-Benz is not the first company to dip into the motorcycle market, but it will be one of the first to offer motorcycles and four-wheel vehicles in the same locations. That’s right, Mercedes-Benz dealerships will soon be set up to be MV Agusta motorcycle dealers as well. Just imagine, “Would you like a Brutale Dragster 800 RR with your Mercedes-Benz SL-Class purchase today.</p>
